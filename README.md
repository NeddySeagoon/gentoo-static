# gentoo-static
Overlay Of Gentoo ebuilds Required to Run A System with a Static /dev

As the ebuilds here are all derived works the licence(s) are as per
the original. That's mostly GPL-2 but do check. 

By default, the olde-gentoo USE flag is used to control the 
dependencies for a static build. To get the static behavior
set USE=-udev olde-gentoo in make.conf

In other cases, the edits are more invasive. If it matters to you,
read the ebuild code.

These ebuilds mostly build for me. As you may expect, various
functionalty is missing, mostly by design.
There are a few things WIP, cavat emptor.

As always, its your Gentoo your way. When it breaks you can
keep all the pieces.
