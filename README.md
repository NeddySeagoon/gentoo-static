# gentoo-static
Overlay Of Gentoo ebuilds Required to Run A System with a Static /dev

As the ebuilds here are all derived works the licence(s) are as per
the original. Thats mostly GPL-2 but do check.

By default, the olde-gentoo USE flag is used to control the 
dependencies for a static build. To get the static behavior
set USE=olde-gentoo in make.conf

In other cases, the edits are more invasive. If it matters to you,
read the code.

These ebuilds build for me. As you may expect, various
functionalty is missing, mostly by design.
